# Purpose

This is a tool for personal use. Meaning, if you want a feature implemented or a bug fixed that
wasn't addressed before, see [Contribution](#contribution). I won't be addressing anything
that is out of my personal scope.

# 10 rating scale, no decimals

- 0 - Worst, so bad you don't even know what you watched. 
- 1 - Unbearable, everything makes you hate it.
- 3 - Has a flaw big enough to make it impossible to watch.
- 5 - No feelings, nothing to remember for, neither awful nor awesome.
- 7 - Has something good about it: good idea, character, plot or just vibe.
- 9 - Remarkable, everything has its place. But has a tiny flaw in story-telling, pacing or smth that breaks the magic.
- 10 - No flaws: characters are deep and developed through-out the show, story has no holes, pacing is superb without leaving useless moments.

And everything in between, if you can't decide between the two.

## Shows

Shows support rating per season because that's often where vibe changes.
Final score is calculated as an average of rating per season.

# Contribution

Just submit your PR :)

Only these criterias have to be met:
- All code is Frontend side only. It has to work on GitHub pages.
- Don't recreate components. If existing button is not generic enough - fix it and reuse it.
