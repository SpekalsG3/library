# How I rate

- 0 - Worst, so bad you don't even know what you watched. 
- 1 - Unbarable, everything makes you hate it.
- 3 - Has just one flaw but big enough to make it impossible to watch.
- 5 - No feeling, not remarkable, nethier awful nor awesome.
- 7 - Has something unique about it: good idea, character or vibe.
- 9 - Remarkable, everything has its place. But has a tiny flaw in story-telling, pacing or smth that breaks the magic.
- 10 - No flaws: characters are deep and developed through-out the show, story has no holes, pacing is superb without leaving useless moments.

And everything in between if can't decide between the two.
